std::thread::joinable

Returns whether the thread object is joinable.

A thread object is joinable if it represents a thread of execution.

A thread object is not joinable in any of these cases:

if it was default-constructed.
if it has been moved from (either constructing another thread object, or assigning to it).
if either of its members join or detach has been called.


Parameters
none

Return value
true if the thread is joinable.
false otherwise.

std::thread::join
void join();

Join thread
The function returns when the thread execution has completed.

This synchronizes the moment this function returns with the completion of all the operations in the thread: This blocks the execution of the thread that calls this function until the function called on construction returns (if it hasn't yet).

After a call to this function, the thread object becomes non-joinable and can be destroyed safely.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

std::thread::detach

void detach();

Detach thread

Detaches the thread represented by the object from the calling thread, allowing them to execute independently from each other.

Both threads continue without blocking nor synchronizing in any way. Note that when either one ends execution, its resources are released.

After a call to this function, the thread object becomes non-joinable and can be destroyed safely.

Parameters
none

Return value
none
